# Business Problem to Solve

* 79% of surveyed organizations indicate that managing cloud spend is a challenge and that 30% of spend is wasted.
* 80% of organizations overshoot their cloud IaaS budgets, 50% accidentally expose data or services, and 47% do not continuously optimize cloud workloads (source: Gartner).
* 81%  of organizations indicate cloud security is a primary challenge, with 95% of issues stemming from misconfigurations (source: Gartner), and 75% from inefficient cloud operations.

***The challenges across FinOps, SecOps, and CloudOps are substantial and can become a serious risk if left unmitigated. Most “solutions” being utilized (for example, home-grown tools or spreadsheets and manual processes) simply fail to address these challenges.***

**SecOps Challenges**

- Unified Visibility
    - Lack of visibility into security threats, attacks and vulnerability data
    - Inability to view security posture across multiple clouds

- Remediation Suggestions
    - Inability to remediate security violations
    - Slowed response time due to manual follow-ups

- Compliance Assessment
    - Inability to assess cloud infrastructure against industry standards, regulations and best practices such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST, ISO, AWS WAF etc.

**FinOps Challenges**

  - Cost Visibility and Reports

    - Inability to view cost details for projects, clouds, accounts, region, environment and resources
    - Inability to understand cost drivers, cost insights and cost anomalies

  - Cost Allocation, Optimization

    - Lack of resource consistency and accountability
    - Inability to charge to appropriate cost centers

**CloudOps Challenges**

  - Autonomous Monitoring
    - Lack of autonomous monitoring affecting service availability and fault tolerance
    - Missed SLAs due to inability to act expeditiously
    - Lack of insights into anomalies 

  - Infrastructure Fulfillment

    - Inability to provision resources with ease
    - Inability to execute post-provisioning activities

  - Incident Ticketing Workflow
    - Lack of 3rd party tool integrations for incident management
    - Inability to route incidents to ITSM tools such as ServiceNow seamlessly
