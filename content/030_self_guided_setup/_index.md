# Self-Paced Workshop

Welcome to the self-guided setup section, where you will learn how to set everything up to participate in the free trial of CoreStack. ​

This workshop requires an AWS account where there is IAM user/identity that has proper permissions to set up the necessary AWS components to work through the workshop. Worried about costs associated with this workshop? Don’t worry, there’s a page that will allow you to request for AWS credits to pay for any costs incurred through this workshop!​

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

1. Creating an AWS account with proper permissions
1. Sign up for CoreStack via AWS Marketplace​
1. Requesting AWS credit from AWS Marketplace​
