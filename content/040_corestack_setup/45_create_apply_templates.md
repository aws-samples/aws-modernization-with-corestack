## Post-Onboarding (Validate your Cloud Accounts & Configurations)

Once you have completed adding your cloud accounts into CoreStack, you can see them listed as part of the Account Summary Dashboard. As a next step, you can validate if the account has been set up correctly for all five Cloud Governance Pillars (OSCAR). ​
​

From the Account Governance Dashboard, select the cloud account you want to review, and click on “View Settings” to see if all the access permissions are available and if there are any errors.
